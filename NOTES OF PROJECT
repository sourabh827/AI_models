Weather Prediction Model Explanation Notes
Import Libraries:

Use libraries to handle data, perform calculations, and build machine learning models. Key libraries include:
pandas for data manipulation.
numpy for numerical calculations.
scikit-learn for machine learning functions.
Load and Prepare Data:

Read the data from a CSV file.
Remove unnecessary columns.
Separate the data into input features (like humidity, wind speed, pressure, and cloud cover) and the target variable (temperature).
Split Data:

Divide the dataset into training and testing sets:
The training set (80% of data) is used to teach the model.
The testing set (20% of data) is used to evaluate how well the model has learned.
Standardize Features:

Adjust the input features so they are on a similar scale (e.g., zero mean and unit variance). This step helps improve the model's performance and learning speed.
Initialize Models:

Create multiple types of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, SGD Regressor) to compare their performance in predicting temperature.
Train Models:

Use the training data to teach each model about the relationship between input features and temperature. Each model learns from the same training data.
Predict and Evaluate:

After training, use each model to make predictions based on the training data.
Calculate performance metrics for each model, including:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Indicates the average error in predictions (lower values are better).
R² Score: Represents the model's accuracy as a percentage (higher values indicate better performance).
Display Results:

Print the error and accuracy of each model to compare their performances.
User Input for Prediction:

Allow the user to enter values for humidity, wind speed, pressure, and cloud cover.
Standardize these input values to match the scale used in training.
Use one of the trained models to predict the temperature based on the user’s input and display the result.
